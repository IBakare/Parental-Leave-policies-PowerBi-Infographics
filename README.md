# Parental-Leave-policies-PowerBi-Infographics

As part of Women's History Month, I'm participating in the Maven Analytics #familyleavechallenge by sharing my insights on parental leave policies across industries and companies in the business world.
I analysed data on the % of paid and unpaid maternity/paternity leave and broke it down by company and industry.

Check out my Visualisation created using PowerBI - it sheds light on how different companies are supporting working parents. Let's continue to push for more equitable policies and support for working families!
